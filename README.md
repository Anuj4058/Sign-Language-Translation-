# 🤟 Real-Time Sign Language Translator

> A powerful and real-time sign language recognition system powered by **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and built to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. 🌍

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-time sign language translation system that recognizes sign gestures using computer vision and converts them into readable English sentences. It leverages deep learning techniques with CNNs for gesture recognition and is built to run efficiently on modern devices.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 **Live Webcam Detection**  
- 🧠 **CNN-based Gesture Recognition**  
- 🗣️ **Text Output of Detected Signs**  
- ⚙️ **Custom Sign Dataset Support**  
- 🔍 **Grad-CAM Visualization for Interpretability**  
- 💻 **User-Friendly Interface** (Web-based or CLI)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** 🐍
- **OpenCV** 📷
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** 🔧
- **Flask** (for backend) 🌐
- **HTML5, CSS3, JS** (for frontend interface)
- **BERT / NLP Toolkit** (optional for sentence correction)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User records or uploads a video of a sign.
2. The system extracts frames and feeds them into a trained **CNN model**.
3. Recognized sign tokens are generated and optionally passed through a **language model**.
4. The final output is displayed as grammatically correct English text in real-time.
